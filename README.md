The Snakebite game currently has the following features:

MENU SCREEN:

-The Play button allows you to start a game of Snakebite with your selected map.

-The Highscore button will display your highscore and the previous score of the last game you played.

-The Settings menu allows you to edit the difficulty (speed of the Snake) for the Classic game mode, and also adjust the volume of the
volume of the game itself.

-The Quit button will return you back to the AUT Application.

-The Game Modes menu allows you to choose between the 3 different modes (Classic, Arcade and Speed Attack)

-The Store menu isn't functional as of yet, but we hope to have this ready in a future update! 

GAMEPLAY:

-Classic mode: Your objective is to simply to pick up the food that spawns on the map to score points. Each piece of food you pick up
gives you a point, but your snake also increases in size! Try get as many points as possible, but avoid hitting the walls, and your tail, or else it's Game Over!

-Arcade mode: Similar to Classic but with the twist of powerups! There are 3 powerups that spawn on the maps. Invincibility, which makes
your Snake able to pass through it's tail for a limited amount of time. Speed Boost, increasing the speed of your Snake and the fun! 
And finally, Random, which gives you a 40% chance of becoming invincible, 40% chance of gaining an instant 5 points, and a 20% chance
of losing the game! So choose wisely!

-Speedattack mode: Also similar to Classic, but with the added stipulation that as your Snake eats the food, thus increasing in size,
it also increases in speed! Adding more difficulty and fun to the game!

MAPS:

-Classic: Nothing but an empty map with walls around it. You touch the walls, it's Game Over.

-Borderless: An empty map with the walls removed, but if you go out one side you come out the other! Use this to your advantage.

-Obstacle: Both the walls along the border from the Classic map, but added walls scattered across the map for added difficulty. 
Manoeuvre through the maze like environment trying your hardest to survive. By far the hardest of the three.
